# tidy-data
Class assignment for Getting and Cleaning data
I only have a single script run_analysis.R it is designed to run from any where as long as the target 'UCI HAR Dataset' is located under the user's home directory.

The instructions mention it running as long as the Samsung data is in the current working directory, I meet this requirement by changing into the appropriate working directory before strating the analysis.
I detailed explanation of the script is included in the CodeBook.mb.
